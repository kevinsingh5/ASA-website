# ASA-website
Code and files for the Astronomy Students Association website at the University of Texas

These are all the scripts that I built for the new version of the ASA website. The website can be found at http://www.as.utexas.edu/~asa/ Do know that I am no longer responsible for updating the website and as such, the content on the live website may differ from the content in this repository. 
For any questions, contributions, or comments, feel free to contact me at ksingh@utexas.edu
